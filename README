Step 0  - Grab the repo
Pull or fork https://github.com/RKZill/R-app 

Step 1 – Allocate Resources
Use azure cloud shell to make a resource group and container registry (or use existing if exists)
NOTE: change ‘myapp-rg’ to be a fitting resource group name. Same with ‘mycontainerregistry’.
# Create a resource group
az group create --name myapp-rg --location eastus

# Create a container registry
az acr create --resource-group myapp-rg --name mycontainerregistry --sku Basic



Step 2 – Create Pipeline
     Step 2.1 
Sign into Azure DevOps and create new pipeline, on connect, select GitHub YAML, and select the repo pulled earlier. 
     Step 2.2
In the configure tab, choose Docker (build and push an image to Azure container registry). 
     Step 2.3
Select an Azure subscription, then select the container registry and create an image name. (Image name does not matter and is not viewable anywhere by users)
     Step 2.4
Click Validate, then Save and Run, add a commit message, and click Save.

Step 3 – Web App Basics
     Step 3.1
Sign into Azure Portal and under Web App select Create a New Web App 
     Step 3.2
In the create web app form, select a subscription, resource group, and name. 
     Step 3.3
On Publish section, select “Docker Container” with Linux as OS option. Click Next.

Step 4 – Web App Docker
In the docker tab, under image source choose Azure Container Registry. Access type should be public, and image-and-tag should be the image name created earlier in step 2.3.  Click Review + Create.

Step 5 – Finalization
On the web app, left side navigation menu there is a configuration option. Click it and click the + New Application Setting button. The new setting should be called WEBSITES_PORT with a value 3838 (the port docker uses). Back to main menu click Restart.

Step 6 – Using the App
Slap it in iframe and you’re good to go! (or use the website <APPNAME>.azurewebsites.net.
<iframe src="https://ryan-r-app.azurewebsites.net/" height="1450px"></iframe>
NOTE: This iframe example uses ryan’s app URL. This will be changed in the final deployment.
NOTE2: Height is set to 1450px to work well with OSCIA main site, alter as needed.
